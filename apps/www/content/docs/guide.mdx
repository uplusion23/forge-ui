This is a short reference guide on how to use `@forge-ui` most effectively.

<Callout className="mt-6">Note: refactoring ui</Callout>

## Colors

Colors used by _forge-ui_ are defined in your `global.css` file. You can find more information <Link href="/docs/theming">here</Link>. Do not use
hardcoded colors, sich as `<span className='text-red-500' />{:tsx}`, or `<div style={{ color: 'red' }}>{:tsx}` in your code, if you want to keep your components
consistent with the rest of the UI, in both light and dark mode. Instead be sure to use the provided color variables.

<GuideDo />
```tsx /text-muted-foreground/#s
<span className="text-muted-foreground">Hello, world!</span>
```

<GuideDont />
```tsx /text-zinc-200\/80/#s
<span style="text-zinc-200/80">Hello, world!</span>
```

## Layout

When working with layout, it can be tempting to use margins and paddings to create space between elements. However,
this can lead to inconsistent spacing between elements. Instead, a components' parent should be responsible for the
spacing between elements. This way, the spacing is consistent across the entire application, and if you choose to
reuse the component elsewhere, you don't have conflicting margins and paddings.

## tailwind

Configuration to help the CLI understand how Tailwind CSS is set up in your project.

See the <Link href="/docs/installation">installation section</Link> for how to set up Tailwind CSS.

### tailwind.config

Path to where your `tailwind.config.js` file is located.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js" | "tailwind.config.ts"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.css

Path to the CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS into your project.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "css": "styles/global.css"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.baseColor

This is used to generate the default color palette for your components. **This cannot be changed after initialization.**

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "baseColor": "gray" | "neutral" | "slate" | "stone" | "zinc"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.cssVariables

You can choose between using CSS variables or Tailwind CSS utility classes for theming.

To use utility classes for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `false`. For CSS variables, set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `true`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "cssVariables": `true` | `false`
  }
}
```

For more information, see the <Link href="/docs/theming">theming docs</Link>.

**This cannot be changed after initialization.** To switch between CSS variables and utility classes, you'll have to delete and re-install your components.

### tailwind.prefix

The prefix to use for your Tailwind CSS utility classes. Components will be added with this prefix.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "prefix": "tw-"
  }
}
```

## rsc

Whether or not to enable support for React Server Components.

The CLI automatically adds a `use client` directive to client components when set to `true`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "rsc": `true` | `false`
}
```

## tsx

Choose between TypeScript or JavaScript components.

Setting this option to `false` allows components to be added as JavaScript with the `.jsx` file extension.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tsx": `true` | `false`
}
```

## aliases

The CLI uses these values and the `paths` config from your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file to place generated components in the correct location.

Path aliases have to be set up in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Important:** If you're using the `src` directory, make sure it is included
  under `paths` in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.
</Callout>

### aliases.utils

Import alias for your utility functions.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "utils": "@/lib/utils"
  }
}
```

### aliases.components

Import alias for your components.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components"
  }
}
```

### aliases.ui

Import alias for `ui` components.

The CLI will use the `aliases.ui` value to determine where to place your `ui` components. Use this config if you want to customize the installation directory for your `ui` components.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "ui": "@/app/ui"
  }
}
```
